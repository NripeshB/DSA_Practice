1. First and Last occurrence in a sorted array.
https://bit.ly/3Ioexjh 
-> use binary search to cut right portion, then left for first and last occurrences.

2. Peak in a mountain array.
https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/
-> uses binary search. Try to code it with using the only two conditional statements.

3. Search in a rotated and sorted array.
https://bit.ly/3rEVSK7
-> requires to find pivot and using it searching via BS to search for the element.

4. Painters partition problem (or book allocation problem)
https://bit.ly/31v3Jiy 
-> requires minimum condition to be satisfied and then execute the BS.

5. Aggressive cows problem.
https://bit.ly/3dkuQ2B 
-> requires the maximum condition to be satisfied and then execute the BS. (If you don't know sorting, it applies that so look that part up.)
