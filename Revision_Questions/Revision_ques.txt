1. First and Last occurrence in a sorted array.
https://bit.ly/3Ioexjh 
-> use binary search to cut right portion, then left for first and last occurrences.

2. Peak in a mountain array.
https://leetcode.com/problems/peak-index-in-a-mountain-array/
-> uses binary search. Try to code it with using the only two conditional statements.

3. Search in a rotated and sorted array.
https://bit.ly/3rEVSK7
-> requires to find pivot and using it searching via BS to search for the element.

4. Painters partition problem (or book allocation problem)
https://bit.ly/31v3Jiy 
-> requires minimum condition to be satisfied and then execute the BS.

5. Aggressive cows problem.
https://bit.ly/3dkuQ2B 
-> requires the maximum condition to be satisfied and then execute the BS. (If you don't know sorting, it applies that so look that part up.)

6. Sum Two numbers of an array.
https://bit.ly/3DXfsDZ
-> requires summing up using carry number separately. Use double pointer approach

7. Deleting the substring inside of the string.
https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-occurrences-of-a-substring/
-> requires to know about the stl for string, find method and erase method.

8. Permutation of a substring inside a string.
https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/
-> Create a counter for each letter stored in an array to apply the logic.

9. Printing the 2D array in a spiral pattern.
https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/
->Keep the upper and lower bounds for the matrix, and update it when the for loop reaches the respective ends.

10. Turning a 2d matrix by 90 degrees
https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/
->First transpose it, then reverse each column

11. Revise code for Merge and Quick Sort.

12. Returning the power set of a given set.
https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/
->By recursiom. Exclusion and inclusion.

13. The Keypad problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/
->By recursion. 

14. The permutations problem.
https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/
->By recursion and a loop with backtracking.

15. Rat in a maze.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rat-in-a-maze-problem/1
->Handle by backtracking and recursion also try using visited matrix approach instead of the old approach.

16. Reversing the K groups of nodes in LL
https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/
->Handle using recursion and keep in mind to check if the group of K elements can be formed.
