Hey! This is my practice repo, as the name hints it.
Here I have included all the practice work I did .
It mostly contains data structures and algorithms theory along with questions. 
I have a pool of Important questions in a text file  named "revision questions" ;
which could be benificial to revise a handful of important DSA questions.
I have also organised seperate questions with the respective Data structure or algorithm name, for the ease of navigation.
