Spanning Tree
A spanning tree of a graph is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph,
is connected, and has no cycles. If a graph has V vertices, then the spanning tree will have exactly 
Vâˆ’1 edges.

Example: Original Graph (G)
  1---2
  |\  |
  | \ |
  3---4

Spanning Tree (T)
  1---2
  |    
  3---4

In this example, the spanning tree includes all vertices (1, 2, 3, 4) but has no cycles.


Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree of a weighted graph where the sum of the weights of the edges is minimized.
